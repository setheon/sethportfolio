**Digital art holds a special place in my heart.** I spent my childhood drawing on physical paper, I never truly grasped physical median. I always felt I was never good enough to call myself an Artist. That all changed the day I purchased a Wacom tablet back in 2017. All of a sudden I unlocked a new median, that provided me with a new way to approach my art. 

**I was able to undo my mistakes,** as well as layering my art digitally in programs such as photoshop, or later on in my digital art journey; Procreate on my iPad. I was able to experiement in ways I didn't know were possible. 

**I went from hating my art output,** to having an undying craving to keep drawing and making beautiful art. From drawing the heavens and galaxies I've know progressed to draw detailed hands, pokemon & robots. 

**This is definitely the more fun side of my portfolio**, none of this work presentated is comission based and is purely just passion projects. I mainly only do comissions for more graphic design orientated work, but if you would like to discuss a comission for my art please <a style="color: #7EC2E6;" href="https://seth.nz/contact">Contact Me.</a> </strong>
