# Mount Ngauruhoe/Mount Doom, New Zealand
#### Mount Doom from Lord of The Rings
**[[from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ngauruhoe)]** <br>
Mount Ngauruhoe (Māori: Ngāuruhoe) is a volcanic cone in New Zealand. It is the youngest vent in the Tongariro stratovolcano complex on the Central Plateau of the North Island and first erupted about 2,500 years ago. Although often regarded as a separate mountain, geologically, it is a secondary cone of Mount Tongariro.
